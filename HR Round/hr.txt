Intoduction ?

Hello, I'm Kajol Kolagir from Pune. 
I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Applications, 
which I completed in 2021 from the College of Computer Science and Information Technology, Latur. 
My passion for understanding how programs work in real life inspired me to pursue this field.

To further enhance my skills, I completed a 30-week full stack web development course at Masai School, 
where I gained hands-on experience with both front-end and back-end technologies.

Following this, I joined Clayfin Pvt Ltd,  where I was trained for 1 and half month and then worked on their main project. 
My role primarily focused on backend development, resolving production issues, and supporting the deployment process during product releases,
and connecting with clients to address any issues or provide explanations as needed.

In my free time, I enjoy creating and sharing videos on YouTube about my professional development.

====================================================================================================================================================

What are your career Objectives? / Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

I am a detail-oriented and analytical person who is always eager to learn and improve. 
I actively seek opportunities to expand my knowledge through training sessions, industry seminars, 
and staying up to date with the latest trends and technologies in my field.

In the next five years, I aim to grow into a senior technical position, 
where I can take on more responsibility, mentor junior staff, and contribute to the success of larger projects. 
My goal is to become a trusted expert within the company, known for solving complex problems 
and handling critical challenges with confidence. Ultimately, I would like to be recognized 
as a key contributor to the technical team and help the company achieve its goals.

========================================================================================================================================================

Why should we hire you? / Why do you think you are eligible for this job? 

First, I am a detail-oriented and analytical person, and this job aligns with my skills. 

I completed a 9-month, full-time course that prepared me well for this role. 
The course followed a 9 AM to 9 PM schedule, with daily tasks and assignments, which helped me build strong 
time management skills and get used to working long hours—similar to a real job.

I also have 1.3 years of experience as a Java Developer at Clayfin Pvt Ltd where I worked on thier main project. 
There, I worked on backend development, resolved production issues, supported deployment process during product releases, 
and connected with clients to handle their concerns and provided the solutions as needed.

In addition, I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Applications, which gave me a solid foundation in IT. 
This background allows me to quickly learn and adapt to new skills.

These experiences make me a strong candidate for this role.

=========================================================================================================================================

Why You left the previous company ?

I decided to leave my previous company because I was on the bench for about 15 days, 
and the current project no longer required additional resources. I felt that it was a good time for me 
to seek new challenges and opportunities where I could continue to grow and develop my skills. 
I’m eager to contribute to a dynamic team and take on responsibilities that will allow me to make a meaningful impact.

=====================================================================================================================================

Rate yourself for Java from 1 to 10 scale ?

I would rate my Java skills as a 7 out of 10. 
I'm comfortable with most advanced concepts, can work independently on complex projects, 
However, there's always more to learn, especially in areas like JVM internals, 
and I am continually keeping up to date to improve my skill.

====================================================================================================================================

Rate yourself for SpringBoot from 1 to 10 scale ?

I would rate my Spring Boot skills as a 7 out of 10. 
I'm good to implementing RESTful APIs, 
and utilizing Spring Boot's various features like Spring Data JPA, security.  
However, I recognize that there's always more to learn, especially in areas like advanced configuration, 
custom annotations, and optimizing performance for high-traffic applications.
